# Connect 4

[Live Demo](https://eractus.github.io/connect4/)

This app is a true-to-its-roots replica of the classic game Connect 4. It is a two player, turn-based app that uses the number keys to dictate where the current player would like to place their next disc.

1. The game starts immediately upon the page loading.
2. Player 1 is red and goes first, while player 2 is yellow and goes second. A legend on the left indicates the current player and his/her disc's color.
3. Using the number keys 1 through 7 (representing the possible columns where you can "drop" your colored disc), select where you want to place your disc.
4. When a player connects four of their colored discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game ends and that player wins!
5. If the entire game rack fills up with no winner, the game ends and it's a draw.
6. When the game ends, a pop up will state the results and allow you to play again by clicking OK or refreshing the page.
